## Installation

This module is installed via npm:

```
npm install --save CSDLParser
```

## Description

This module provides a simple interface to parse [Common Schema Definition Language](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/odata-v4.0-part3-csdl.html) (CSDL) files as defined by the OData v4 specification. This module was originally written to provide a more comprehensive test suite for projects utilizing CSDL for typing, but could also be used by OData clients to obtain type information.
